## YoutubeSummary
YoutubeSummary is a Large Language Model(LLM) solution that helps you summarize videos on Youtube.

Although many youtubers generate their own summarization and snippets of the videos, it's not always the case. YoutubeSummary provides **concise summary** of each essential point of the video, and includes the **starting point** from the video so you have the chance to dive deep into the interested content.
